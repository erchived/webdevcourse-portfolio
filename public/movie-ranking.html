<h1>Top 5 Best Dishes According to Me</h1>
<h2>Instead of creating Movie Ranking Project, I want to twist it into Food Ranking Project</h2>
<hr/>
<h2>Any Kind of Sambal 🥵</h2>
<p>
    (Bawang, Tomat, Terasi, Green Chili—You Name It!)<br/>
    The ultimate sidekick! Sambal makes everything better—-grilled fish, fried chicken, crispy tofu… it's basically the soul of Sundanese food.<br/>
    Go-to spots: Warung Spesial Sambal, Sambal Bakar, Jeletot.
</p>
<h2>Grilled Suan Cai Yu or Pickled Veggie Fish 🐟🔥</h2>
<p>
    This Chinese dish hits different. You can get it soupy or grilled, but grilled with a kick of mala or Sichuan sauce? <br/>
    Go-to spots: Ban Tian Yao, Chi Yu Ba (budget-friendly version!)
</p>
<h2>Bakmi 🍜</h2>
<p>
    Noodles with all the good stuff—chicken, pork, or fish balls. My fav version? Thin, slightly chewy noodles that don't fight back when you chew.<br/>
    Go-to spots: Bakmi Aling, Bakmi Garing Awei, Bakmi Ono.
</p>
<h2>Pho-nomenal Pho 🌿🥣</h2>
<p>
    A warm bowl of Vietnamese comfort—fragrant herbs, clear broth, and smooth rice noodles. Perfect for rainy days or when you're feeling meh. <br/>
    Go-to spots: Pho Baba, Pho Minh.
</p>
<h2>Japanese Food 🇯🇵🍣</h2>
<p>
    Let's be real—Japanese food is top-tier. Ramen, sushi, curry, nikudon, takoyaki, okonomiyaki, soba... it’s impossible to pick just one! <br/>
Go-to spots: Japan itself (lol) but also Marugame Udon, Obihiro Nikudon.
